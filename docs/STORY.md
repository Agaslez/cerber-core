**From restaurants to SaaS** - bringing the same discipline, attention to detail, and customer focus that defined our hospitality work.

## Why Cerber Exists

Cerber Core was born from real pain points encountered while building SaaS applications with AI assistance:

- **Problem:** AI tools don't understand project boundaries
- **Result:** Schema drift, architecture violations, CI fail loops, production incidents
- **Solution:** Enforce a human-written contract (CERBER.md) as single source of truth

The tool is tested in production at Eliksir SaaS and has saved countless hours of debugging and prevented multiple production incidents.

## 🏆 Proof: Used in Production

Cerber Core protects real production applications. See it in action:

**Eliksir SaaS Platform:**

- **Frontend CI Pipeline:** [Guardian Schema Check + lint + tests](https://github.com/Agaslez/Eiksir-front-dashboard/actions/runs/20668597387)
- **Backend CI Pipeline:** [Quality Gate + deploy checks](https://github.com/Agaslez/Eliksir-Backend-front-dashboard/actions/runs/20664365046)

These aren't demo projects - they're live production systems serving real users, protected by Cerber contracts since day one.
