**Agata Ślęzak** - Business owner and project sponsor
- Former restaurant co-owner

> *"None of this would exist without Agata's unwavering belief and support. When I wrote my first `console.log`, she saw a future developer. Eight months later, here we are."* — Stefan

**From restaurants to SaaS** - bringing the same attention to quality and customer experience that we learned in hospitality.

## Why Cerber Exists

Cerber Core was born from real pain points encountered while building SaaS applications with AI assistance:

- **Problem:** AI tools don't understand project boundaries
- **Result:** Schema drift, architecture violations, CI fail loops, production incidents
- **Solution:** Enforce a human-written contract (CERBER.md) as single source of truth

The tool is tested in production at Eliksir SaaS and has saved countless hours of debugging and prevented multiple production incidents.
