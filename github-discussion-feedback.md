Hi GitHub community! 👋

I'm Stefan, creator of **Cerber Core** - a tool that turns architecture documentation into enforceable code rules.

## 🎯 The Core Idea

**Traditional workflow:**
```
Architect designs → Writes docs → Developers drift → Reviews catch violations too late
```

**With Cerber:**
```
Architect defines rules once → Guardian blocks violating commits → Architecture stays intact
```

## 💰 The Value Proposition

**"Pay your architect once. Cerber guards the plan forever."**

- Setup: 4 hours (architect creates BIBLE.md + Guardian schema)
- Enforcement: Automatic forever
- Savings: $6,000/month per developer (no constant architect reviews)
- ROI: 230% on Day 1

## 🤔 Questions for You

**1. Does this resonate?**
- Is "roadmap becomes executable" clear?
- Does the pain point (architecture drift) match your experience?

**2. What's your current solution?**
- How do you enforce architecture rules today?
- Code reviews? Linters? CI checks? Nothing?

**3. What would stop you from trying Cerber?**
- Setup time? Learning curve? Integration concerns?
- What documentation/examples would help?

**4. What's missing from the pitch?**
- Does it clearly explain the problem AND solution?
- What questions do you still have?

## 📦 Try It (30 seconds)

```bash
npm install cerber-core --save-dev
npx cerber-guardian --help
```

## 🙏 Why I'm Asking

I'm a career changer (30 years: banking, hospitality, business, chef) who started coding May 2025. Built 3 production SaaS apps in 8 months with AI assistance. Cerber Core is my first open-source project.

**I need your honest feedback** to make this useful for real developers, not just my use case.

**TL;DR:** Does "your architecture roadmap becomes enforceable code" make sense? What would make you try it?

Thank you! 🙏
