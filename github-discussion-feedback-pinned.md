## 3 Quick Questions

Please share your thoughts on any (or all) of these:

### 1️⃣ **Scope: What should Cerber protect?**

Right now, Cerber enforces:
- Pre-commit validation (Guardian)
- CI workflow integrity
- Optional post-deploy health checks

**Question:** What else should Cerber guard?
- Schema drift detection?
- Package.json security audits?
- Environment variable validation?
- Database migration safety?
- Other? (tell us!)

---

### 2️⃣ **UX: How was the setup experience?**

**Question:** Did `npx cerber init` + `doctor` work smoothly?
- ✅ Worked perfectly (share your doctor output in `#showcase`!)
- ⚠️ Confusing (what was unclear?)
- ❌ Broken (paste logs below)

**If you have logs/errors:**
```bash
# Run doctor with verbose output
npx cerber doctor

# Paste output here (wrap in ``` code blocks)
```

### 3️⃣ **Adoption: What's blocking you?**

**Question:** If you're NOT using Cerber in production yet, why?
- Missing features?
- Documentation unclear?
- Don't trust new tools?
- Already have similar setup?
- Other concerns?
